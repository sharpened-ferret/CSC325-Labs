% Code for an Expert System Shell:

% See Bratko pages 353-356.
%
% The code below is for the expert system shell. This is the shell that you need to use
% to write your own expert system; that is, your task will be to write the rules
% which use the shell. Get the shell running in Prolog and test using Bratkoâ€™s
% examples.
%
% Interaction with user and why and how explanation

% Operators for easy to read rules.
:- op( 800, fx, if).
:- op( 700, xfx, then).
:- op( 300, xfy, or).
:- op( 200, xfy, and).
:- op( 800, xfx, <=).
